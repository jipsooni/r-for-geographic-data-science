# Table operations



This section illustrates the re-shape and join functionalities of the Tidyverse libraries using simple examples. The following sections instead present a more complex example, loading and wrangling with data related to the [2011 Output Area Classification](https://github.com/geogale/2011OAC) and the [Indexes of Multiple Deprivation 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015).

## Table manipulation

### Long and wide formats

Tabular data are usually presented in two different formats.

- **Wide**: this is the most common approach, where each real-world entity (e.g. a city) is represented by *one single row* and its attributes are represented through different columns (e.g., a column representing the total population in the area, another column representing the size of the area, etc.).

|City      |Population|Area|Density|
|----------|----------|----|-------|
|Leicester |   329,839|73.3|  4,500|
|Nottingham|   321,500|74.6|  4,412|

- **Long**: this is probably a less common approach, but still necessary in many cases, where each real-world entity (e.g. a city) is represented by *multiple rows*, each one reporting only one of its attributes. In this case, one column is used to indicate which attribute each row represent, and another column is used to report the value. 

|City      |Attribute |Value  |
|----------|----------|-------|
|Leicester |Population|329,839|
|Leicester |      Area|   73.3|
|Leicester |   Density|  4,500|
|Nottingham|Population|321,500|
|Nottingham|      Area|   74.6|
|Nottingham|   Density|  4,412|

The `tidyr` library provides two functions that allow transforming wide-formatted data to a long format, and vice-versa. Please take your time to understand the example below and check out the [`tidyr` help pages](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) before continuing.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
city_info_wide <- data.frame(
    city = c("Leicester", "Nottingham"),
    population = c(329839, 321500),
    area = c(73.3, 74.6),
    density = c(4500, 4412)
  ) %>%
  tibble::as_tibble()

city_info_wide %>%
 knitr::kable()
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
city_info_long <- city_info_wide %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    # exclude IDs (city names) from the pivoted columns
    cols = -city,
    # name for the new column containing
    # the names of the old columns
    names_to = "attribute",
    # name for the new column containing
    # the values included under the old columns
    values_to = "value"
  )

city_info_long %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
city_info_back_to_wide <- city_info_long %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    # column containing the attribute names
    names_from = attribute,
    # column containing the values
    values_from = value
  )

city_info_back_to_wide %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Join

A join operation combines two tables into one by matching rows that have the same values in the specified column. This operation is usually executed on columns containing identifiers, which are matched through different tables containing different data about the same real-world entities. For instance, the table below presents the telephone prefixes for two cities. That information can be combined with the data present in the wide-formatted table above through a join operation on the columns containing the city names. As the two tables do not contain all the same cities, if a full join operation is executed, some cells have no values assigned.

|city      |telephone_prefix|
|----------|----------------|
|Leicester |            0116|
|Birmingham|            0121|

|city      |population|area|density|telephone_prefix|
|----------|----------|----|-------|----------------|
|Leicester |   329,839|73.3|  4,500|            0116|
|Nottingham|   321,500|74.6|  4,412|                |
|Birmingham|          |    |       |            0121|

As discussed in the lecture, the `dplyr` library offers different types of join operations, which correspond to the different `SQL` joins illustrated in the image below.  The use and implications of these different types of joins will be discussed in more detail in the GY7708 module next semester.  

![](images/joins.png){width=75%}

Please take your time to understand the example below and check out the [related `dplyr` help pages](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html) before continuing. The first four examples execute the exact same *full join* operation using three different syntaxes: with or without using the pipe operator, and specifying the `by` argument or not. Note that all those approaches to writing the join are valid and produce the same result. The choice about which approach to use will depend on the code you are writing. In particular, you might find it useful to use the syntax that uses the pipe operator when the join operation is itself only one stem in a series of data manipulation steps. Using the `by` argument is usually advisable unless you are certain that you aim to join two tables with all and exactly the column that have the same names in the two table.

Note how the result of the join operations is *not* saved to a variable. The function `knitr::kable` is added after each join operation through a pipe `%>%` to display the resulting table in a nice format.



```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
city_telephone_prexix <- data.frame(
    city = c("Leicester", "Birmingham"),
    telephon_prefix = c("0116", "0121")
  ) %>%
  tibble::as_tibble()

city_telephone_prexix %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Read and write data

The [`readr` library](https://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html) (also part of the Tidyverse) provides a series of functions that can be used to load from and save data to different file formats. 

Download from Blackboard (or the [data](https://github.com/sdesabbata/granolarr/tree/master/data) folder of the repository) the following files:

- `2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv`
- `IndexesMultipleDeprivation2015_Leicester.csv`

Create a *Practical_214* project and make sure it is activated and thus the *Practical_214* showing in the *File* tab in the bottom-right panel. Upload the two files to the *Practical_214* folder by clicking on the *Upload* button and selecting the files from your computer (at the time of writing, Chrome seems to upload the file correctly, whereas it might be necessary to change the names of the files after upload using Microsoft Edge).

Create a new R script named `Data_Wrangling_Example.R` in the *Practical_214* project, and add `library(tidyverse)` as the first line. Use that new script for this and the following sections of this practical session.

The [2011 Output Area Classification](https://github.com/geogale/2011OAC) (2011 OAC) is a geodemographic classification of the census Output Areas (OA) of the UK, which was created by [Gale et al. (2016)](http://josis.org/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/232) starting from an initial set of 167 prospective variables from the United Kingdom Census 2011: 86 were removed, 41 were retained as they are, and 40 were combined, leading to a final set of 60 variables. [Gale et al. (2016)](http://josis.org/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/232) finally used the k-means clustering approach to create 8 clusters or supergroups (see [map at datashine.org.uk](https://oac.datashine.org.uk)), as well as 26 groups and 76 subgroups. The dataset in the file `2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv` contains all the original 167 variables, as well as the resulting groups, for the city of Leicester. The full variable names can be found in the file `2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Lookup.csv`.

The [Indexes of Multiple Deprivation 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015) (see [map at cdrc.ac.uk](https://maps.cdrc.ac.uk/#/geodemographics/imde2015)) are based on a series of variables across seven distinct domains of deprivation which are combined to calculate the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015 (IMD 2015). That is an overall measure of multiple deprivations experienced by people living in an area. These indexes are calculated for every Lower layer Super Output Area (LSOA), which are larger geographic unit than the OAs used for the 2011 OAC. The dataset in the file `IndexesMultipleDeprivation2015_Leicester.csv` contains the main Index of Multiple Deprivation, as well as the values for the seven distinct domains of deprivation, and two additional indexes regarding deprivation affecting children and older people. The dataset includes scores, ranks (where 1 indicates the most deprived area), and decile (i.e., the first decile includes the 10% most deprived areas in England).

-->

The `read_csv` function reads a *Comma Separated Values (CSV)* file from the path provided as the first argument. The code below loads the 2011 OAC dataset. The `read_csv` instruction throws a warning that shows the assumptions about the data types used when loading the data. As illustrated by the output of the last line of code, the data are loaded as a tibble 969 x 190, that is 969 rows -- one for each OA -- and 190 columns, 167 of which represent the input variables used to create the 2011 OAC.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
leicester_2011OAC <- 
  readr::read_csv("2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv")

leicester_2011OAC %>% 
  dplyr::select(OA11CD,LSOA11CD, supgrpcode,supgrpname,Total_Population) %>%
  dplyr::slice_head(n = 3) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
leicester_2011OAC <- 
  readr::read_csv(
    paste0(
      Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), 
      "/data/", 
      "2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv"
    )
  )

leicester_2011OAC %>% 
  dplyr::select(OA11CD,LSOA11CD, supgrpcode,supgrpname,Total_Population) %>%
  dplyr::slice_head(n = 3) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

The code below loads the IMD 2015 dataset.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Load Indexes of Multiple deprivation data
leicester_IMD2015 <- 
  readr::read_csv("IndexesMultipleDeprivation2015_Leicester.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load Indexes of Multiple deprivation data
leicester_IMD2015 <- 
  readr::read_csv(
    paste0(
      Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), 
      "/data/", 
      "IndexesMultipleDeprivation2015_Leicester.csv"
    )
  )
```

The function `write_csv` can be used to save a dataset as a `csv` file. For instance, the code below uses `tidyverse` functions and the pipe operator `%>%` to:

1. **read** the 2011 OAC dataset again directly from the file, but without storing it into a variable;
2. **select** the OA code variable `OA11CD`, and the two variables representing the code and name of the supergroup assigned to each OA by the 2011 OAC (`supgrpcode` and `supgrpname` respectively);
3. **filter** only those OA in the supergroup *Suburbanites* (code `6`);
4. **write** the results to a file named *Leicester_Suburbanites.csv*.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
readr::read_csv("2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv") %>%
  dplyr::select(OA11CD, supgrpcode, supgrpname) %>%
  dplyr::filter(supgrpcode == 6) %>%
  readr::write_csv("Leicester_Suburbanites.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
readr::read_csv(
    paste0(
        Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), 
        "/data/", 
        "2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv"
      )
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(OA11CD, supgrpcode, supgrpname) %>%
  dplyr::filter(supgrpcode == 6) %>%
  readr::write_csv(
      paste0(
        Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), 
        "/data/", 
        "Leicester_Suburbanites.csv"
      )
  )
```


### File paths

File paths can be specified in two different ways:

- **Absolute file path**: the full file path, from the *root* folder of your computer to the file. 
  - The absolute file path of a file can be obtained using the `file.choose()` instruction from the *R Console*, which will open an interactive window that will allow you to select a file from your computer. The absolute path to that file will be printed to console.
  - Absolute file paths provide a direct link to a specific file and ensure that you are loading that exact file.
  - However, absolute file paths can be problematic if the file is moved, or if the script is run on a different system, and the file path would then be invalid
- **Relative file path**: a partial path, from the current working folder to the file. 
  - The current *working directory* (current folder) is part of the environment of the `R` session and can be identified using the `getwd()` instruction from the *`*R Console*.
    - When a new R session is started, the current *working directory* is usually the computer user's home folder.
    - When working within an R project, the current *working directory* is the project directory.
    - The current working can be manually set to a specific directory using the function `setwd`.
  - Using a relative path while working within an R project is the option that provides the best overall **consistency**, assuming that all (data) files to be read by scripts of a project are also contained in the project folder (or subfolder).

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Absolute file path
# Note: the fist / indicates the root folder
readr::read_csv("/home/username/GY7702/data/2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv")

# Relative file path
# assuming the working directory is the user home folder
# /home/username
# Note: no initial / for relative file paths
readr::read_csv("GY7702/data/2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv")


# Relative file path
# assuming you are working within and R project created in the folder
# /home/username/GY7702
# Note: no initial / for relative file paths
readr::read_csv("data/2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv")
```


## Data wrangling example

### Re-shaping 

The IMD 2015 data are in a *long* format, which means that every area is represented by more than one row: the column `Value` presents the value; the column `IndicesOfDeprivation` indicates which index the value refers to; the column `Measurement` indicates whether the value is a score, rank, or decile. The code below illustrates the data format used for the `IndicesOfDeprivation` table, and showing the rows for the LSOA including the University of Leicester (feature code `E01013649`).

```{r, echo=TRUE}
leicester_IMD2015 %>%
  dplyr::filter(FeatureCode == "E01013649") %>%
  dplyr::select(FeatureCode, IndicesOfDeprivation, Measurement, Value) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

In the following section, the analysis aims to explore how certain census variables vary in areas with different deprivation levels. Thus, we need to extract the `Decile` rows from the IMD 2015 dataset and transform the data in a *wide* format, where each index is represented as a separate column. 

To that purpose, we also need to change the name of the indexes slightly, to exclude spaces and punctuation, so that the new column names are simpler than the original text, and can be used as column names. That part of the manipulation is performed using `mutate` and functions from the [`stringr` library](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/).

\newpage

```{r, echo=TRUE}
leicester_IMD2015_decile_wide <- leicester_IMD2015 %>%
  # Select only Socres
  dplyr::filter(Measurement == "Decile") %>%
  # Trim names of IndicesOfDeprivation
  dplyr::mutate(
    IndicesOfDeprivation = str_replace_all(IndicesOfDeprivation, "\\s", "")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    IndicesOfDeprivation = str_replace_all(IndicesOfDeprivation, "[:punct:]", "")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    IndicesOfDeprivation = str_replace_all(IndicesOfDeprivation, "\\(", "")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    IndicesOfDeprivation = str_replace_all(IndicesOfDeprivation, "\\)", "")
  ) %>%
  # Spread
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = IndicesOfDeprivation,
    values_from = Value
  ) %>%
  # Drop columns
  dplyr::select(-DateCode, -Measurement, -Units)
```

Let's compare the columns of the original *long* IMD 2015 dataset with the *wide* dataset created above, using the function `colnames`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
leicester_IMD2015 %>% 
  colnames() %>%
  # limit width of printing area
  print(width = 70)

leicester_IMD2015_decile_wide %>% 
  colnames() %>%
  # limit width of printing area
  print(width = 70)
```

In `leicester_IMD2015_decile_wide`, we now have only one row representing the LSOA including the University of Leicester (feature code `E01013649`) and the main Index of Multiple Deprivations is now represented by the column `IndexofMultipleDeprivationIMD`. The value reported is the same -- that is 5, which means that the selected LSOA is estimated to be in the range 40-50% most deprived areas in England -- but we changed the data format.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Original long IMD 2015 dataset
leicester_IMD2015 %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    FeatureCode == "E01013649",
    IndicesOfDeprivation == "Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)",
    Measurement == "Decile"
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(FeatureCode, IndicesOfDeprivation, Measurement, Value) %>%
  knitr::kable()

# New wide IMD 2015 dataset
leicester_IMD2015_decile_wide %>%
  dplyr::filter(FeatureCode == "E01013649") %>%
  dplyr::select(FeatureCode, IndexofMultipleDeprivationIMD) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Join

As discussed above, two tables can be joined using a common column of identifiers. We can thus join the 2011 OAC and the IMD 2015 datasets into a single table. The LSOA code included in the 2011 OAC table is used to match that information with the corresponding row in the IMD 2015. The resulting table provides all the information from the 2011 OAC for each OA, plus the Index of Multiple Deprivations decile for the LSOA containing each OA.

That operation can be carried out using the function `inner_join`, and specifying the common column (or columns, if more than one is to be used as identifier) as argument of `by`. Note that using `inner_join` would result in dropping any row which doesn't have a match in the other table, either way. In this case, that should not happen, as all OAs are part of an LSOA, and any LSOA contains at least one OA.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
leicester_2011OAC_IMD2015 <- 
  leicester_2011OAC %>%
  inner_join(
    leicester_IMD2015_decile_wide, 
    by = c("LSOA11CD" = "FeatureCode")
  )
```

As each LSOA contains multiple OAs, each row from the `leicester_IMD2015_decile_wide` table is matched to multiple rows from the `leicester_2011OAC` table. For instance, as shown in the table below, the information from the IMD 2015 dataset about the LSOA encompassing the University of Leicester (feature code `E01013649`) is joined to multiple rows from the 2011 OAC dataset, including the OA encompassing the University of Leicester (feature code `E00068890`) as well as other neighbouring OAs.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
leicester_2011OAC_IMD2015 %>%
  # Note that the LSOA11CD column needs to be used
  # as the previous join as combined 
  # LSOA11CD and FeatureCode
  # into one, name LSOA11CD
  dplyr::filter(LSOA11CD == "E01013649") %>%
  dplyr::select(OA11CD, LSOA11CD, supgrpname, IndexofMultipleDeprivationIMD) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Once the result is stored into the variable `leicester_2011OAC_IMD2015`, further analysis can be carried out. For instance, `count` can be used to count how many OAs fall into each 2011 OAC supergroup and decile of the Index of Multiple Deprivations. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
leicester_2011OAC_IMD2015 %>%
  dplyr::count(supgrpname, IndexofMultipleDeprivationIMD) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

As another example, the code below can be used to group OAs based on the decile and then calculate the percentage of adults not in employment using the `u074` (*No adults in employment in household: With dependent children*) and `u075` (*No adults in employment in household: No dependent children*) variables from the 2011 OAC dataset.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
leicester_2011OAC_IMD2015 %>%
  dplyr::group_by(IndexofMultipleDeprivationIMD) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    adults_not_empl_perc = (sum(u074 + u075) / sum(Total_Population)) * 100
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```



## Exercise 214.1

Extend the code in the script `Data_Wrangling_Example.R` to include the code necessary to solve the questions below. Use the full list of variable names from the 2011 UK Census used to generate the 2011 OAC thatcan be found in the file `2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Lookup.csv` to indetify which columns to use to complete the tasks. 

**Question 214.1.1:** Write a piece of code using the pipe operator and the `dplyr` library to generate a table showing the percentage of EU citizens over total population, calculated grouping OAs by the related decile of the Index of Multiple Deprivations, but only accounting for areas classified as Cosmopolitans or Ethnicity Central or Multicultural Metropolitans.

**Question 214.1.2:** Write a piece of code using the pipe operator and the `dplyr` library to generate a table showing the percentage of EU citizens over total population, calculated grouping OAs by the related supergroup in the 2011 OAC, but only accounting for areas in the top 5 deciles of the Index of Multiple Deprivations.

**Question 214.1.3:** Write a piece of code using the pipe operator and the `dplyr` library to generate a table showing the percentage of people aged 65 and above, calculated grouping OAs by the related supergroup in the 2011 OAC and decile of the Index of Multiple Deprivations, and ordering the table by the calculated value in a descending order.



## Exercise 214.2

Extend the code in the script `Data_Wrangling_Example.R` to include the code necessary to solve the questions below.

**Question 214.2.1:** Write a piece of code using the pipe operator and the `dplyr` and `tidyr` libraries to generate a long format of the `leicester_2011OAC_IMD2015` table only including the values (census variables) used in *Question 214.1.3*.

**Question 214.2.2:** Write a piece of code using the pipe operator and the `dplyr` and `tidyr` libraries to generate a table similar to the one generated for *Question 214.2.1*, but showing the values as percentages over total population.
