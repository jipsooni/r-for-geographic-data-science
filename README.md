# R for Geographic Data Science

<img src="src/images/r-for-geographic-data-science-cover.png" class="cover" width="250" height="328"/>

This book is an introduction to geographic data science using `R`, which I designed as a companion for the module [GY7702 R for Data Science](https://le.ac.uk/modules/2021/gy7702) of the [MSc in Geographic Information Science](https://le.ac.uk/courses/geographical-information-science-msc/2021) at the [School of Geography, Geology, and the Environment](https://le.ac.uk/gge) of the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/). As such, it is very much *a work in progress*.



## Aims and learning objectives

The materials included in this book have been designed for a module focusing on the programming language R as an effective tool for data science for geographers. R is one of the most widely used programming languages, and it provides access to a vast repository of programming libraries, which cover all aspects of data science from data wrangling to statistical analysis, from machine learning to data visualisation. That includes a variety of libraries for processing spatial data, perform geographic information analysis, and create maps. As such, R is an extremely versatile, free and opensource tool in geographic information science, which combines the capabilities of traditional GIS software with the advantages of a scripting language, and an interface to a vast array of algorithms. 

The materials aim to cover the necessary skills in basic programming, data wrangling and reproducible research to tackle sophisticated but non-spatial data analyses. The first part of the module will focus on core programming techniques, data wrangling and practices for reproducible research. The second part of the module will focus on non-spatial data analysis approaches, including statistical analysis and machine learning.

The book and lecture slides use `#FFF0E2` as background colour to avoid the use of a pure white background, which can make reading more difficult and slower for people with dyslexia. All colours have also been checked for readability using [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/).

This repository includes teaching materials that were created by me ([Dr Stefano De Sabbata](https://stefanodesabbata.com)) for the module [GY7702 R for Data Science](https://le.ac.uk/modules/2021/gy7702), while working at the [School of Geography, Geology, and the Environment](https://le.ac.uk/gge) of the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/). I would also like to acknowledge the contributions made to parts of these materials by [Prof Chris Brunsdon](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/people/chris-brunsdon) and [Prof Lex Comber](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1020/professor-lex-comber) (see also [An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/an-introduction-to-r-for-spatial-analysis-and-mapping/book241031), Sage, 2015), [Dr Marc Padilla](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=NSxM1aEAAAAJ), and [Dr Nick Tate](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geography/people/njt9), who convened previous versions of the module at the University of Leicester.

Last but not least, I would like to acknowledge the miriad of small contributions by users of many plaftforms, including the [Stack Exchange Network](https://stackexchange.com/) (e.g., [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), provided under [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/)), who have both asked and answered many of the questions I had while coding this book. It would be impossible to trace back all their contributors through the pages, scripts and years, but they are there. The learning materials were created using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) (with many thanks to [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/) for those fantastic tools and related documentation), and [GitHub](https://github.com/sdesabbata).
