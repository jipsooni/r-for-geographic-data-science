# Reading list {-}

Each week you will be assigned with some reading from the books listed below. In particular, we will be using [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham and [*Programming Skills for Data Science*](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Freeman-Programming-Skills-for-Data-Science-Start-Writing-Code-to-Wrangle-Analyze-and-Visualize-Data-with-R/PGM2047488.html) by Michael Freeman and Joel Ross for the first two units, and *Discovering Statistics Using R* by Andy Field, Jeremy Miles and Zoë Field, and [*Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/big_data_and_business_intelligence/9781788295864) by Brett Lantz for the third and fourth unit. For a sneak peek at how to use R for geographic information analysis, I can suggest  *An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping* by Chris Brunsdon and Lex Comber and *Geocomputation with R* by Robin Lovelace.
